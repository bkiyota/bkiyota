          <h4>Reading Log</h4>
          <p>This page features a timeline for the books that I have read since 2015. I used to avoid books like the plague, likely due to my disinterest in the books chosen for high school assignments. My feelings really changed when I had the chance to read a few books on my own schedule, talking about things that I find interesting. Now reading is one of my favourite activities to chill and relax, and my list of books to read continues to grow at a much faster pace than I can actually read them! I enjoy non-fiction science books for the most part, but have been slowly expanding the genres I've looked at.</p>
          <p>Note that the dates listed on the timeline are rough approximations. The backgrounds for each slide are also coloured according to the categorical genre that I've arbitrarily chosen.</p>
