This repository contains some of the HTML code that were used to build my personal website! It was a so-called passion project, 
and was built using the Flask framework. Note that this first build is kinds of the website's germinal state where I had zero Python or HTML knowledge beforehand, so that may be able to explain some of the quirks that may be seen in the code. 

Hopefully, as time goes on, it will continue to evolve into something more refined.
